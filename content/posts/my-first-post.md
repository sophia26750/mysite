# A Starlit Night

In the quiet of the evening light,  
The stars awake and sparkle bright.  
`Whispers of dreams in the cool night air,  `
A universe vast, a world so fair.

The moonlight dances on gentle waves,  
A symphony of night that nature craves.  
Each star a story, a silent song,  
A journey endless, a night so long.

Embrace the night, let your spirit soar,  
In this starlit wonder, forevermore.
